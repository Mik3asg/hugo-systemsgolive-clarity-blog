## Overview
This project demonstrates building a basic REST API in Golang, implementing CRUD operations with a PostgreSQL database for data persistence. The application utilises Gorilla Mux for routing, PostgreSQL for the database, and Docker for containerisation.

The API manages user information, including name, email, and city.

**Note:** This demo does not include an user interface as it has not been built for the purpose of this demo. The code for this demo is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mik3asg/Rest-API-Golang-Mux-PostgreSQL-Docker).



## Pre-requisites/Assumptions:
- Download and [Install GO](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your local machine. 
- Download and [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
- Use your preferred IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
- Download and [Install Postman Desktop Agent](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#the-postman-desktop-agent) to test the API locally.  
- Use a PostgreSQL desktop/terminal client (e.g. Sqlectron).

## Setting up the environment

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mik3asg/Rest-API-Golang-Mux-PostgreSQL-Docker.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Rest-API-Golang-Mux-PostgreSQL-Docker
    ```
3. Dependencies:

This project uses Go modules for dependency management. The necessary dependencies, including Gorilla Mux for handling HTTP routing and pq for PostgreSQL database interaction, are already included in the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. 
These dependencies were initially installed using the following commands:

```bash
go mod init api  # Initializes a GO module named 'api' for dependency management
go get github.com/gorilla/mux  # Installs Gorilla Mux for handling HTTP routing in Go
go get github.com/lib/pq  # Installs pq, PostgreSQL driver for Go's database/sql package
```
However, users do not need to run these commands themselves, as the dependencies are already included in the project. Simply clone the repository and ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
If you're not familiar with Go modules, you can learn more about them [here](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules).

4. Run Docker Engine on your local machine



## Setting up PostgreSQL Authentication

To configure authentication for the PostgreSQL database used in this project, you need to set up environment variables in a `.env` file. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following lines:

    ```plaintext
    POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_username
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
    POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name
    ```

    Replace `your_postgres_username`, `your_postgres_password`, and `your_database_name` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.

3. Save the `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`file, and Docker Compose will automatically read these environment variables when you run `docker-compose up`.

These environment variables will be read by Docker Compose and used to authenticate your application with the PostgreSQL database.



## Start the PostgreSQL Database Container 

Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database service (`go-db`) defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.
    
```bash
docker compose up -d go-db  
```


## Build and Run the custom CRUD GO API

These commands build the custom Go application defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file and then run it using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose build  # Build the custom Go app
docker compose up go-app  # Run the custom Go app
```


## Validate the setup

Run the following commands:

```bash
docker images  # Check the status of Docker images for go-db and go-app
docker ps  # Check the status of running Docker containers for go-db and go-app
```


## Test API endpoints

Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080` . We will use Postman as an API Platform to test our API endpoints. 

In addition, we can use a PostgreSQL client to check the data being stored in the database for each endpoint. Please refer to your database credentials defined in your `.env` file.



### Create User with POST 

- Endpoint: `POST localhost:8000/users`
- To create a new user, send a POST request to `localhost:8000/users` with a JSON body containing the user details.
- Use a PostgreSQL client to verify the new user data was inserted into the database.



### GET All Users

- Endpoint: `GET localhost:8000/users` 
- To get all existing users, send a GET request to `localhost:8000/users`.
- The response will contain a JSON array of all users. 
- Check the PostgreSQL client to verify the user data being returned.


### GET Single User

- Endpoint: `GET localhost:8000/users/<id>`
- To get a specific user, send a GET request to `localhost:8000/users/<id>` where `<id>` is the id of the desired user.
- Check the PostgreSQL client that the correct user data is being returned based on the id.



### PUT Update User

- Endpoint: `PUT localhost:8000/users/<id>`
- To update a user, send a PUT request to `localhost:8000/users/<id>` where `<id>` is the id of the user to update.
- Use the PostgreSQL client to verify the user data was updated in the database. 



### DELETE User

- Endpoint: `DELETE localhost:8000/users/<id>` 
- To delete a user, send a DELETE request to `localhost:8000/users/<id>` where `<id>` is the id of the user to delete.
- Check the PostgreSQL client that the user was removed from the database.


### Error Handling

- Invalid Endpoint: `GET/PUT/DELETE localhost:8000/users/<invalid_id>` 
- If an invalid `<id>` is provided in the endpoint for GET, PUT or DELETE requests, the API will return a 404 status with the message "User not found".
- The PostgreSQL client will show that no data was changed.
