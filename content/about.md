# Welcome to my blog
Welcome to SystemsGo.live! The purpose of this blog is to share technical insights, hands-on experiences, and solutions to real-world challenges in cloud computing, automation, networking, Linux, microservices, cybersecurity, and beyond.

# Who am I?
![Mickael Asghar](/images/mickael-pic-45.png)

I'm Mickael Asghar, a DevOps Engineer with 14+ years of experience spanning Automotive, Energy, Telecom, Aerospace, and Social Care sectors. With a Master's in Network Architecture and Security from ESIGELEC (France, 2010), I've built my career around creating robust technical solutions.
My expertise focuses on:

- Cloud Computing & DevOps
- Infrastructure Automation
- Microservices Architecture
- Security Implementation
- Scalable Solutions Design

Born in France to Pakistani parents, I now call Bristol, UK home, where I live with my Spanish wife and three kids. This multicultural background has shaped me into an adaptable professional who thrives on new challenges. My ability to communicate fluently in French, English, Urdu, and Spanish brings valuable perspectives to collaborative projects.

Beyond tech, I maintain a balanced life through regular walks, quality family time, and staying sharp with workouts and engaging podcasts.

# Current Role & Expertise
I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer at Carebeans, a UK software company transforming the social care sector with innovative digital solutions.
Our team develops comprehensive care planning software and mobile apps that help care providers work more efficiently across the UK.

In my DevOps role, I bridge development and operations, automating deployment processes, managing cloud infrastructure, and ensuring our platforms stay secure and scalable. 
It's all about keeping our care management solutions running reliably for the healthcare teams who depend on them.

In Summer 2024, Carebeans joined forces with Quality Compliance Systems (QCS), a subsidiary of RLDatix. This merger is helping us expand our reach and enhance our digital care management solutions throughout the UK social care sector.
