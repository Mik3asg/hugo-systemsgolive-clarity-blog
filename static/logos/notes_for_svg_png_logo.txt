We used the SVG code from the 'systemsgolive-logo-transparent.svg' file.

To review the visual appearance, we used the online tool: 'https://www.svgviewer.dev/svg-to-png'

Steps taken:
    - Used the Preview and Adjust option at the bottom to modify the background (only for preview purposes).
    - The original SVG file has a transparent background.
    - Converted the SVG to PNG using the PNG tab and downloaded it in 0.5x and 1x resolutions.
    - Imported both PNG and SVG files into the /logos directory.
    - Updated the params.toml file accordingly.
